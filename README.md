An implementation of the board game `Space Alert`

Milestones:
```
1. Read from a text file of the format

Enemies:
<enemy name> <time t+n>

Players:
<card top> <card bottom>
... (multiples of 13)

and if win, output damage done to each section of the ship, which players
are knocked out, total points accrued by team.

2. Add UI layer for simulation.

3. Add interface for playing via the UI (hot seat probably).

4. Add online interaction.
```
